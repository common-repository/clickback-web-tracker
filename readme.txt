Clickback adds a small line of code to your WordPress site so you can identify companies who have visited your website but haven't converted.

== Description ==

Clickback is website visitor identification software that provides you with the names of companies that visit your website, but don’t convert. This allows you to turn anonymous visits into sales prospects. This plugin lets you easily add your unique Clickback tracking code into the header of your WordPress site.

== Features ==

Fill your sales funnel with the 98% of website visitors that don’t contact you by identifying key decision-makers who work at the companies that visit your website. Have your sales team follow up with early-stage prospects before your competitors do. You can create automated email notifications to manage your pipeline more efficiently because you’ll know when a current prospect revisits your site. Take advantage of our sophisticated website visitor identification software that shows you leads, not just analytics (such as IP addresses), so you can grow your revenue.
